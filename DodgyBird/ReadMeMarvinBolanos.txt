My program is based on the game flappy bird. The game is simple, you just have to avoid the upcoming Nyan Cats. 
You have to keep on pressing the left click or key on the mouse(NOTE: you cannot HOLD the left click or key)
This will only be a single player game but the only difference is that this game is a dodging game!
The program solves boredom because it will give players the opportunity to challenge themselves.
The only primary features with this game, is that you can move flappy bird right, left, down, up, and you have to dodge the upcoming Nyan cats.
The game will have a click menu, it should be simple to follow.
